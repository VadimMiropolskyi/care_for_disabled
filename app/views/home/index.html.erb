              <p>I believe that everyone deserves care and attention, regardless of their abilities. My aim is to help people with disabilities maintain their independence and live their lives with dignity.

                I provide a wide range of care services for people with disabilities. I can help with caring for older people who need help with everyday tasks such as hygiene, dressing, eating and medication.

                I also help people with disabilities who need special care and support with basic tasks. I am available to help with moving, feeding, treating wounds, etc.

                I really love my job and try to create a warm, comfortable and safe environment for all my clients. I respect the individuality of each person and strive to provide a personalised approach and the best possible care according to their needs.

                If you need help caring for a loved one or a friend with a disability, please contact me. I am always ready to provide my help and support to make life easier for your loved ones and maintain their independence and dignity.

             <h2>What i do...</h2>
             <p>The NDIS provides funding to eligible people with disability to gain more time with family and friends, greater independence, access to new skills, jobs, or volunteering in their community, and an improved quality of life.

                The NDIS also connects anyone with disability to services in their community.

                This includes connections to doctors, community groups, sporting clubs, support groups, libraries and schools, as well as providing information about what support is provided by each state and territory government.

                The NDIS now supports over 500,000 Australians with disability to access the services and supports they need.</p>
